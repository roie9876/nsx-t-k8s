The goal of this series of posts is to outline and explain the steps to integrate VMware NSX-T Platform to Kubernetes control plane.

Software components used are shown below.

- vCenter 6.7 U3 (Build 14368073)
- ESX 6.7 U3 (Build 14320388)
- NSX-T 2.5.0 (Build 14663978)
- NSX Container Plugin 2.5.0 (Build 14628220)
- Ubuntu Server 16.04.5
- Docker CE 18.09.6
- Kubernetes 1.15.5


It is highly recommended to check the following resources for compatibility requirements
* VMware Product Interoperability Matrices  
https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&175=&2=&1=
* VMware NSX Container Plugin Release Notes
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/index.html

This series does **NOT** provide the generic intro level information on NSX-T or K8S. To have a basic understanding of NSX-T please watch the VMworld 2018 session recordings. Similarly for K8S, Pluralsight and A Cloud Guru trainings by Nigel Poulton is highly recommended.
